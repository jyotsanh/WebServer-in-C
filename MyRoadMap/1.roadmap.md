# Roadmap to Build a Web Server in C
    1. Set Up Your Development Environment
        - Install a C compiler (e.g., GCC). **done**
        - Choose an IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Vim, or Code::Blocks). **done**
        - Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track your code changes. **done**
    2. Learn the Basics of C Programming
        Familiarize yourself with basic C syntax, data types, and control structures. **done**
        Understand pointers, memory management, and file handling. **partially done**
    3. Understand Networking Concepts **right here**
        Learn about TCP/IP and how the internet works.
        Familiarize yourself with sockets and how they are used for communication between devices.
    4. Explore the HTTP Protocol
        Understand the structure of HTTP requests and responses.
        Learn about different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and status codes.
    5. Create a Basic TCP Socket Server
        Write a C program that creates a TCP socket.
        Use bind() to associate the socket with an IP address and port.
        Use listen() to wait for incoming connections.
        Use accept() to handle incoming client connections.
    6. Handle HTTP Requests
        Read the incoming request from the client using recv().
        Parse the HTTP request to extract the method, path, and headers.
        Handle different HTTP methods accordingly.
    7. Send HTTP Responses
        Create an HTTP response based on the request received.
        Use send() to send the response back to the client.
        Include appropriate headers and body content (e.g., HTML, JSON).
    8. Implement Multi-threading (Optional)
        If you want to handle multiple clients simultaneously, consider using threads or forking processes.
        Learn about POSIX threads (pthreads) for multi-threading in C.
    9. Testing Your Web Server
        Use tools like curl or Postman to send HTTP requests to your server.
        Test various scenarios, including different HTTP methods and paths.
    10. Enhancements and Features
        Add features like logging requests, serving static files, or implementing routing.
        Consider adding support for HTTPS using SSL/TLS if you want to secure your server.
    11. Deploy Your Web Server
        Test your server in a local environment first.
        Consider deploying it on a cloud platform or a VPS.
    12. Stream Your Progress
        While building your server, stream your coding sessions to share your learning experience.
        Engage with viewers and gather feedback.
