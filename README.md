# WebServer-in-C
What is this?
Welcome to my wild journey of creating a web server in C. If you’ve ever wanted to read from a file and write to a file for a boring project, well, I’ve been there. So, I’m here to actually do something cool (hopefully) with C. I’m going to learn the art of C, one line at a time, and maybe mess up a lot in the process, but hey, that’s the fun part!

I don’t know what exactly I’m creating yet (it’s a work in progress, okay?), but I will build a web server with only 45-50 lines of code. Keep your expectations low, folks!

# How to get started?
Clone this repo, because who doesn’t like a good clone?
Check out the code (prepare to copy-paste like a pro).
Run the server, and maybe break something along the way.
Learn: Don’t forget to learn something cool (I promise it’s a little fun).
# Troubleshooting
Bug? Error? Oh no, please open an issue. It’s what I’m here for, right?
Can’t get it working? Same, me too. Open an issue, and let’s figure it out together.
